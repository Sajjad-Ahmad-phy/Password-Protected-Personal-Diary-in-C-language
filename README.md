# Password-Protected-Personal-Diary-in-C-language
We have created a password-protected diary as a semester project.
The code is written in C programming language. 
The diary has a few properties which include:
  1. Password Protect
  2. Add New Data
  3. Edit existing data
  4. Delete existing data
  5. Play a game: 
     If someone gets bored, there is a simple but entertaining game. The game is: the computer has selected a random number between 1 and 100 and the player has to guess it. The total score is 200 if the player picks up the wrong number he/she will be charged 5 and vice versa.
